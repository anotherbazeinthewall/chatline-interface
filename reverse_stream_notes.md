When implementing a reverse stream effect in the terminal, don't fall into the trap I did of trying to manipulate text in-place with cursor positioning and backspace characters. I spent hours trying different approaches with ANSI codes and even the curses library, all of which led to visual artifacts, strobing effects, and inconsistent behavior. The key breakthrough came when I understood that treating terminal animation like traditional frame-based animation is far more reliable. Instead of trying to modify what's already on the screen, generate complete frames and display them in sequence. Keep your state management simple - you don't need complex stacks of message history or special animation logic. Each frame should be a complete representation of what you want the user to see at that moment. For the reverse streaming effect specifically, maintain your base content (like demo text) separately from the response text you want to remove, then combine them at display time. Remove words chunk by chunk from the response text only, while keeping the base content stable in each frame. This approach is not only more reliable but actually simpler than trying to manipulate cursor position or modify text in-place. Remember: clear screen, display complete frame, small delay - that's all you need. The terminal may seem like it wants character-by-character manipulation, but treating it like a simple frame buffer will save you a lot of headaches.
