When implementing a dot loader, the key to success is carefully managing both the animation state and the terminal output. The most effective approach proved to be running the animation in a separate thread while handling the response streaming in the main async flow. Critical lessons learned include: hiding/showing the cursor for a cleaner visual experience, using carriage returns (\r) with space padding to properly clear previous output, handling different punctuation characters gracefully by detecting them at initialization, ensuring the animation always completes on exactly three characters before showing content, and maintaining clean thread cleanup in finally blocks. One subtle but important detail was ensuring full separation between the animation ending and content beginning by waiting for the animation to complete its cycle (using an Event) before showing the first chunk of content. The approach of using a daemon thread for animation proved robust, as it ensures the thread terminates if the main program exits unexpectedly. Terminal width handling (padding with spaces) was also crucial to prevent unwanted line wrapping or visual artifacts.
