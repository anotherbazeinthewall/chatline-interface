When implementing a text streaming processor, it's important to carefully consider how different styles and formats interact with each other. We learned that ANSI color codes and formatting codes (like italic) behave differently - colors can simply override each other, but formats need to be explicitly turned on and off. The key to success was separating these concerns and using a stack-based approach to track active patterns. Early attempts to handle everything with regex or treating all ANSI codes the same way led to issues with styles getting "stuck" or not resetting properly. The stack-based approach, combined with explicit format control and clear pattern definitions, proved most reliable. Another crucial insight was making the pattern definitions configurable while maintaining strict validation to prevent conflicts. The ability to control whether delimiters (like quotes or underscores) appear in the output adds flexibility without compromising the core functionality. For future implementations, it's recommended to start with a simple, working pattern handler and gradually add complexity, always ensuring that the base state (color and formatting) can be properly restored after applying patterns. The most robust solution ended up being one that clearly separated pattern definition from pattern processing, and maintained explicit control over both color and formatting states throughout the streaming process.
