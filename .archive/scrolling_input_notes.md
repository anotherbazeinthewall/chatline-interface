It's important to understand that when building a scrolling terminal interface with persistent messages, the key is separating your concerns properly. Don't try to store message history in your content or treat previous messages as special cases - this leads to duplication and unwanted behavior. Instead, maintain just one previous message separately from your base content, and combine them only at display time. Let your entire combined content scroll together naturally, rather than trying to handle different parts of the content differently during animation. The scrolling effect itself is straightforward (clear screen, print content, delay, repeat), but the complexity comes from managing state. By keeping your state management simple - one variable for unchanging demo content, one for the last message - you avoid the temptation to build complex message stacks or special animation logic that can break the illusion of smooth scrolling.
